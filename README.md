    Project     "About"  page:


Create a portfolio of various stocks and ETFs to visualize how a long-term holding investment portfolio has/would have performed over time to better gain insight into the portfolio's risk and actual performance(i.e. information other than simply the net return)


Instructions:

- Add positions to your portfolio by specifying a stock ticker as well as the shares and date purchased.

- Postions "opened" can be deleted from the portfolio, or the shares bought can be edited.

(The earliest date of purchase that can be set is roughly 20 days before the current date)

(The latest date of purchase that can be set is roughly 7 years before the current date)

- Choose from 3 modes of viewing the portfolio's performance over time(portfolio as percentage, individual postions as percentage, and individual postions as dollars).


- Because this simulation assumes a long-term holding period, daily open prices are used to make calculations(e.g. portfolio return percentage). As such, exact purchase prices cannot be specified.
